# ATM Simulator in Java
A simple console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system implemented in Java.  
This project is designed for beginners to understand **core Java OOP concepts** while simulating basic ATM operations.

## 🚀 Features
✅ User Registration (username + PIN)
✅ Secure Login Authentication
✅ Deposit Money
✅ Withdraw Money (with balance validation)
✅ Check Balance
✅ Transaction History Tracking
✅ Menu-driven Interface

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
Classes and Objects
Encapsulation
Static Utility Class (`Utils` for Scanner)
List Collection (`ArrayList`) for transaction history
Control Flow (`if`, `switch`, loops)

## 📂 Project Structure
Main.java → Entry point, ATM menu system
UserAuthentication → Handles registration & login
ATMOperations → Core ATM functions (deposit, withdraw, balance, history)
Utils → Shared Scanner utility


## 📸 Example Flow
=== Welcome to ATM System ===
Press 1 to Register, 2 to Log In
1
Enter new username: Taimour Mushtaq
Enter new PIN: 1234
Account created successfully!
=== Log In ===
Enter username: Taimour Mushtaq
Enter PIN: 1234
Login successful!
Choose an option:
Withdraw
Deposit
Check Balance
Transaction History
Exit


## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/TAIMOURMUSHTAQ/ATM-Simulator-Java.git
Open in IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code.
Run Main.java.

📚 Learning Goals
This project is perfect for:
Practicing Java basics
Applying OOP principles
Understanding menu-driven applications
Preparing for Java assignments/interviews

🌟 Future Improvements
To make this ATM simulator more realistic and advanced, the following enhancements can be added:
🔐 File Persistence / Database Integration – Save accounts and transactions permanently instead of only runtime memory.
👥 Multiple User Accounts – Allow many users with separate balances and histories.
⚠️ Custom Exception Handling – Handle errors like invalid PIN, insufficient funds, and wrong input more gracefully.
📊 Enhanced Transaction History – Include timestamps and transaction IDs.
💻 Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Convert from console to GUI using Java Swing/JavaFX for better user experience.
🌍 Networking Support – Simulate bank server interactions for deposits/withdrawals.
📱 Mobile-Friendly Version – Extend logic for Android app using Java/Kotlin.
